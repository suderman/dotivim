This vim syntax script highlights configuration files used with James
Yonan's OpenVPN application (http://openvpn.net).

Features:

  * Highlights options, comment lines, and arguments
  * Recognizes quoted strings and escaped characters (e.g. \\, \")
  * Flags arguments given for options that take no arguments
  * Special highlighting for route and server command arguments

Reporting Issues:

  If you discover an OpenVPN file that this script highlights incorrectly,
  please email the author (address at the top of the file) with the
  following information:

    * Problem OpenVPN file WITH ANY SENSITIVE INFORMATION REMOVED
    * The release version of this script (see top of the file)
    * If possible, a patch to fix the problem

Design Notes:

  Part of this script is autogenerated from the output of openvpn --help.
  The source code for generating the script is available from the author on
  request (see email address at the top of the script).  The script should
  build from source on most Linux systems with openvpn installed.

  The build system that generates this script strips special CVS tokens
  (like "Id:") so that CVS no longer recognizes them.  This allows users to
  place this script in their own version control system without losing
  information.  The author encourages other vim script developers to adopt a
  similar approach in their own scripts.
